- **Goal:**  
  Python script runs in the background, scans all devices for open ports, and updates the SQL database accordingly.

- **Progress:**  
  - Created a SQL database in the MariaDB container with 2 tables: one for inventory and one for open ports logging.  
  - Manually populated the inventory DB with IP, MAC address, name, OS, and last seen.  
  - Added Python test script `db_connection_test.py` to the `scripts/` folder.  
  - Purpose: establish a connection to the MariaDB container and confirm we can query the `devices` table using values from `.env`.  
  - Verified that `.env` loading works automatically via `python-dotenv`, so no need to manually `source` environment variables.  
  - Queried device by hostname ("thinkpad") and successfully retrieved details (`device_id`, `hostname`, `ip_address`).  
  - This script is only a first test to prove database connectivity before moving on to the real port-scanning and updating database.
